## Version 1.0 (14/06/23 -> 23/06/23)
This version of the website was built over the course of a week during the _nology front-end development course. .

This website is built as an imitation of the Windows 9x series of OSes (Windows 95, Windows 98). It sports the following features

-  A clickable start button that can bring up a start menu, and options that appropriately change colour on hover.
-  A real-time clock updating in the right side of the task bar
-  Task tabs that spawn and despawn upon the opening and closing of their designated programs.
-  Three programs accessible from the desktop
   -  A **Documents** viewer which lets the user view the text files they've saved during the current session, and click on them to open them in **Notepad**.
   -  **Notepad**, where users can edit simple text documents and save them to the **Documents** viewer. The user can save new files or overwrite an existing file.
   -  An **IRC** emulator that opens a simple chatbox the user can interact with. Random messages from random users will file in, giving the illusion of an active chat. The user can enter their own messages, and if they send one of a few "greeting messages", the users of the chatroom will greet them right back.

### The Greetings List 
- 'hi'
- 'hello'
- 'good morning'
- 'good afternoon'
- 'gm'
- 'yo'
- 'sup'
- 'heya'
- 'hey'
